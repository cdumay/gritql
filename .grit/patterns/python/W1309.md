# [EXPERIMENTAL] f-string-without-interpolation

Using an f-string that does not have any interpolated variables.

```grit
engine marzano(0.1)
language python

`f"$data"` as $fstring => `"$data"` where {
    $fstring <: contains r"^f.*",
    ! $data <: contains or { "{", "}" }
}
```

## Example

```python
print(f"Subscription does not exist, nothing to do")

does="does"
print(f"Subscription {does} not exist, nothing to do")
```

## Result

```python
print("Subscription does not exist, nothing to do")

does="does"
print(f"Subscription {does} not exist, nothing to do")
```
